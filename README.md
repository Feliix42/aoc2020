# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my solution for this year's [Advnet of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
Feel free to take a look, even though I'm not demanding high standards of the code quality.

2020 has been very frustrating and demanding for everyone so instead of solving the challenges in my comfort zone (i.e., Rust), I opted to solve these tasks in a family of language that fits the theme of this year: C and C++.
Let's see how long I will keep that up before doing a table flip and going for something more comfortable. :D
