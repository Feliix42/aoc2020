# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my solutions for this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
Feel free to take a look, even though I'm not making any demands on the code quality.

2020 has been very frustrating and demanding for everyone so instead of solving the challenges in my comfort zone (i.e., Rust), I opted to solve these tasks in a family of languages that fits the theme of this year: C and C++.
Let's see how long I will keep that up before doing a table flip and going for something more comfortable. :D
